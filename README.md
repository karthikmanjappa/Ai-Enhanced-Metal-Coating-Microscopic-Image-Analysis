## Machine Learning and Image Processing in Coating Analysis
#### Metal coatings are critical in various industries, providing protection and enhancing the durability of materials. To ensure the quality of these coatings, microscopic analysis is essential for identifying defects, assessing uniformity, and predicting performance. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) and image processing have revolutionized the way coating analysis is conducted, making it faster, more accurate, and less dependent on human intervention.
## Image Processing in Coating Analysis
Image processing techniques enhance the input data for machine learning models, ensuring the most relevant features are captured. For coating analysis, the following techniques are commonly applied:
## 1.Image Preprocessing
#### Noise Reduction: Techniques like Gaussian blur or median filtering remove unwanted noise in images.
#### CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)
#### Enhances the visibility of fine details, making subtle defects detectable.
## 2.Image Segmentation:
#### SLIC (Superpixel Linear Iterative Clustering): Groups pixels into meaningful regions, enabling focused analysis of coating patterns and defects.
#### Thresholding and Edge Detection: Identifies boundaries of defects for precise localization.
## 3.Feature Extraction:
#### Texture Analysis: Evaluates surface uniformity using metrics such as entropy and variance.
#### Structural Features: Detects cracks, pores, or irregularities by analyzing geometric properties.
